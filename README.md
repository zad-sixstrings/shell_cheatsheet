# shell_cheatsheet.txt
My shell cheat sheet in a 'cat' friendly version, to be used in terminal directly. It is largely based on [Dave Child](https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/)'s cheat sheet that can be found [here](https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/pdf/).
